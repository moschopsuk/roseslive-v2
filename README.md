# Roses Live 2.0
This is very heavy WIP, the idea is to create a more modern version of the roseslive site using best development practices.
The backend will be Nodejs using graphQL to communicate to a react site.

Install the deps
```
yarn
```

To compile the code from typescript to JS
```
yarn build
```

To run the server
```
yarn start
```

Trying to ensure good code quality
```
yarn lint
yarn test (comming soon)
```
